        The following link leads you to the download website for the Java SE Development Kit 8. Make sure you download one of the two versions:
        - 32-bit: jdk-8u161-linux-i586.tar.gz
        - 64-bit: jdk-8u161-linux-x64.tar.gz

    2. Move the extracted JDK files to /opt/Oracle_Java/
        - Extract the JDK files from the downloaded *tar.gz*.
        - Create the folder *Oracle_Java* in the directory */opt/*:
        ```
        sudo mkdir /opt/Oracle_Java
        ```
        - Move the folder *jdk1.8.0_161* to */opt/Oracle_Java/*:
        ```
        sudo mv ~/Downloads/jdk1.8.0_161/ /opt/Oracle_Java/
        ```

    3. Set up and configure the evironment variables
        Set up the environment variables by executing the following commands one by one:
        ```
        sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/java" "java" "/opt/Oracle_Java/jdk1.8.0_161/bin/java" 1

        sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/javac" "javac" "/opt/Oracle_Java/jdk1.8.0_161/bin/javac" 1

        sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/javaws" "javaws" "/opt/Oracle_Java/jdk1.8.0_161/bin/javaws" 1

        sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/jar" "jar" "/opt/Oracle_Java/jdk1.8.0_161/bin/jar" 1
        ```

        Configure the environment variables by executing the following commands one by one:
        ```
        sudo update-alternatives --set "java" "/opt/Oracle_Java/jdk1.8.0_161/bin/java"

        sudo update-alternatives --set "javac" "/opt/Oracle_Java/jdk1.8.0_161/bin/javac"

        sudo update-alternatives --set "javaws" "/opt/Oracle_Java/jdk1.8.0_161/bin/javaws"

        sudo update-alternatives --set "jar" "/opt/Oracle_Java/jdk1.8.0_161/bin/jar"
        ```

    After finishing the aforementioned steps the Java JDK installation is complete and the development with Java can begin.
