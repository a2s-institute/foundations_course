Prerequisites for Diving (ROS Sessions)
:brain: Knowledge required:
Linux basics Linux Command Line and Shell Scripting Bible(https://www.google.com/search?q=linux+scripting+bible) ideally the whole part 1:
Familiarity with Ubuntuâ€™s desktop environment. Linux Command Line and Shell Scripting Bible chapter 1 section "The Linux Desktop Environment".
Proficiency with basic terminal commands (bash). I recommend Linux Command Line and Shell Scripting Bible chapter 3 and 4.
Understand GNU/Linux file system. Linux Command Line and Shell Scripting Bible chapter 7 and 8.
Python/C++ skills, including basic OOP concepts. For recap python check Think Python(https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) for C++ check Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++(https://www.google.com/search?q=Programming%3A+Principles+and+Practice+Using+C%2B%2B)
Basics of VCS (Version control system) with git. My personal recommendation is the Git Book(https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) chapter 1, 2, and 3.
:toolbox:  Software requirements (you MUST have them installed before the session):
OS: Ubuntu 22.04 Desktop. I personally recommend a native Ubuntu installation on your computers. Dual-boot also works but very impractical for daily use. If you want to use a virtual machine you are free to do so but due to student volume issues I can't provide support for all of you with bugs or problems with virtual machines (that's why I recommend native installations), but if you still want to venture on your own to use virtual machines I recommend using VMWare Player it's free for personal non-commercial use (for GNU/Linux and Windows users). If you use Mac, may our lord and savior Steve Jobs be with you.
Install: ROS Humble, check the official documentation and follow Ubuntu Debian packages (recommended) (https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html) to install it.
