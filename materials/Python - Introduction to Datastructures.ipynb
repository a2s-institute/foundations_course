    "\n",
    "**Welcome to the Data Structures in Python course!**\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook serves as an introduction to fundamental data structures essential for Python programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Course Outline:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lists:** Ordered, mutable collections that can store elements of diverse data types.\n",
    "* **Tuples:** Ordered, immutable collections similar to lists but cannot be modified after creation.\n",
    "* **Sets:** Unordered collections containing unique elements only. Sets are mutable, allowing additions and removals.\n",
    "* **Dictionaries:** Unordered, mutable collections with key-value pairs. Keys are unique and used for efficient data retrieval.\n",
    "* **Stacks:** LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) data structures, where elements are added and removed from the top.\n",
    "* **Queues:** FIFO (First-In-First-Out) data structures, where elements are added to the back and removed from the front.\n",
    "* **Priority Queues:** Similar to queues, but elements are prioritized based on a specific value (higher priority elements are retrieved first).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gain a comprehensive understanding of each data structure's properties (ordered/unordered, mutable/immutable).\n",
    "* Explore common operations like insertion, deletion, searching, and iteration for each structure.\n",

Priority Queues can be implemented using lists, and the sort method, but we saw why it is not a good idea. Priority Queues can also be implemented using the heapq module, which provides a heap data structure. The heap data structure is a binary tree, where the parent node is smaller than the child nodes. The heapq module provides methods to push and pop elements from the heap, and also to heapify a list. The time complexity of the push and pop methods is O(log n), meaning it takes logarithmic time to push and pop elements from the heap, irrespective of the number of elements in the heap. The final result is the same as using a list, but the time taken is less, especially for large number of elements."

    "## Additional Data Structures in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "While we've covered several fundamental data structures, Python offers a rich set beyond the built-in `list`, `tuple`, `set`, and `dict`. Let's explore some noteworthy examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Collections Module:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `collections` module provides additional specialized data structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`Counter`:** A subclass of dictionary specifically designed for counting hashable objects. It provides convenient methods for tracking element frequencies.\n",
    "* **`ChainMap`:** Creates a single view of multiple dictionaries, enabling efficient searching across multiple layers.\n",
    "* **`UserDict`, `UserList`, `UserString`:** Wrapper classes that provide additional functionalities on top of the built-in `dict`, `list`, and `string` classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linked Lists:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Not directly included in the `collections` module, linked lists can be implemented using custom classes.\n",
    "* **Structure:** Each element (node) holds data and a reference to the next node in the sequence.\n",
    "* **Advantages:** Efficient for insertions and deletions at the beginning or end (constant time complexity).\n",
    "* **Disadvantages:** Random access by index is less efficient (linear time complexity) compared to lists.\n"
