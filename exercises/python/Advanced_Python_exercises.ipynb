    "The goal of this assignment is for you to get used to python and the advantages of using libraries like numPy and matplotlib. Feel free to experiment with the libraries any way you like(you should have already done this by now). One of the main benefits of using numPy is to reduce the usage of loops, so work on that(minimize using loops as much as you can). \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you get the hang of doing that, understanding the language and the reducing the complexity of each problem becomes so much easier !  \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the questions can be completed using functions/classes. This way, you can use different data as inputs and hence get different results. I suggest that you dont just work toward the assignment for the sake of completion, but to test your inquisitivity and expand your knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have not imported any of the libraries for you. Some of the libraries that you will be using in this notebook will be math, numpy, matplotlib and csv. Figure out how they are used and the benefits of using these libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are <b>ONLY</b> 30 questions and some of them are super easy to do and some require you think about the question a little. Before you ask me a question for help, research about the your question and then tell me what you found and why you think does not work. I do not think the questions are too complicated to be solved. You just need to spend enough time on them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Submission for this assignment is on Sunday, 10th September by midnight. To submit, <b>either print the page</b> in pdf format or you can also use the <b>'download as'</b> option in the <b>'file'</b> menu(you may face some errors). If you complete it before that time, let me know and maybe I can give you more work to do :P\n",
